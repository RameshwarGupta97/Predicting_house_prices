# Predicting_house_prices
## Please refer to "infot780-final-project-report-Final Group-1" for the work done in this project.
* This project is to predict the Sale Price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. By taking into consideration of over 79 features of a residential home, we will build a model which can predict the price of that house.


## About Dataset:

* We obtained our dataset from the kaggle competetions and the source is : https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview.
* This dataset contains Train and Test datasets.
* The training dataset has 81 columns with 1460 instances.
* The test dataset has 80 columns with 1460 instances.
* We need to predict the sales price in the dataset.
* We will be using complete data from the project. It has large number of dimensions with 80 independent variables.


## Modeling Process:

* For pre-processing we will use dimensionality reduction techniques to use these predictors in our solution.
* We will use different models with default parameters and later use Randomcvsearch to fine tune the hyper parameters to find the best model.

## Final Results:

* Our dependent variable is SalePrice variable which we will train the model to predict.
* Final results would be predicting the values in the test dataset and updating the sample submission file as required in the kaggle competetion.
